## Project Overview
#### The Stock Sentiment Analysis project aims to predict stock price movement based on sentiment analysis of relevant financial news and social media posts. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project classifies news articles and social media data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These sentiments are then combined with stock price data to train a machine learning model capable of predicting future stock price trends.

## Project Components
### 1. Data Ingestion
Input Data: The data includes two primary sourcesâ€”historical stock price data and financial news or social media posts. The stock price data contains columns such as 'Date,' 'Open,' 'Close,' 'High,' 'Low,' and 'Volume.' News data includes headlines and articles related to stock performance.
Tools Used: Python (Pandas) is used to load, clean, and process the stock price data and news sentiment data.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Text Preprocessing: Implemented NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization to clean the text data.
Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF or Word2Vec to convert the text data into numerical format for machine learning algorithms.
Sentiment Analysis: Each news or social media post is categorized as positive, negative, or neutral using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or libraries like NLTK or TextBlob.
### 3. Feature Engineering
Sentiment Score Aggregation: Combined daily sentiment scores with historical stock data to create new features such as 'daily sentiment score.'
Time Series Features: Integrated rolling averages and other technical indicators (e.g., Moving Average, RSI) to capture stock price trends.
### 4. Model Building
Machine Learning Models: Trained several models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to predict stock price movements based on sentiment and historical stock price data.
Evaluation: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure they provide reliable predictions.
### 5. Model Deployment
Deployment Strategy: Developed a REST API using Flask/FastAPI to expose the model for real-time prediction. The model takes in new sentiment data and predicts the stock price movement.
Cloud Deployment: Deployed the application on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP to enable scaling and real-time processing.
